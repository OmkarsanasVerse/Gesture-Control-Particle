🚀 Hand Gesture Controlled 3D Particle System ✋✨



I built an interactive web-based project where hand gestures control a real-time 3D particle system directly in the browser using a webcam.
This project combines AI-powered computer vision with 3D WebGL graphics to create an immersive, gesture-driven experience.



🔹 Key Features
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands
5,000+ animated particles rendered with Three.js
Gesture-based controls:
Finger count → Shape transformation (Sphere, Heart, Saturn, Flower)
Pinch gesture → Particle size
Hand movement → Color and rotation
Smooth particle morphing and high-performance rendering


🔹 Tech Stack
 JavaScript | Three.js | MediaPipe | WebGL | HTML | CSS

 
🔹 What I Learned
Real-time computer vision in the browser
Gesture-based interaction design
High-performance 3D rendering
Smooth animations using interpolation (LERP)
This project helped me explore the intersection of AI, computer vision, and creative coding, and it strengthened my understanding of building interactive AI-driven interfaces.
